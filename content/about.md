Hey, how's it going? I am a final-year PhD student at Dublin City University, supervised by <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/martinfriesen/home" class="special-link" target="_blank">Martin Friesen</a>. I hold a Government of Ireland Postgraduate Scholarship (GOIPG/2023/3129) awarded by the Irish Research Council (now Research Ireland). Before coming to Dublin, I obtained a Bachelor's and a Master's degree in Mathematics from the University of Wuppertal, Germany. For further details, please consult my <a href="/documents/CV.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  <i class="fa fa-file-pdf"></i> CV.

My current research focuses on stochastic Volterra processes, a versatile class of non-Markovian processes, and on questions that broadly arise in the context of stochastic stability and asymptotic analysis, thereby bridging the gap between abstract mathematics and applications in statistics and mathematical finance. In this context, I particularly enjoy exploiting the interplay between functional and stochastic analysis.


I’m always glad to talk about math and my research, so don’t hesitate to get in touch! Just send me an email (ole.canadas2@mail.dcu.ie) or find me in X137 on the DCU Glasnevin Campus.
